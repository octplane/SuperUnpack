h1. About

SuperUnpack is a ruby library coded by Pierre Baillet. Originally developped around 2006. It was uploaded to GitHub in April, 2011.

h1. HISTORY

SuperUnpack was written after I got tired of parsing EXIF, IPTC, MP3s and Palm Pilot (!) by hand. This DSL implements simple binary primitives that allows one to quickly parse a binary file and explore it via an OO interface.
